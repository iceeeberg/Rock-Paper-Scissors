## Summary 

This was the first game application I created with the use of HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. I had a lot of fun making it and look forward to adding more game applications to my repository. The biggest takeaways I took from creating this game was using  the JavaScript function Math.floor as well as gaining more insight on how to style my click events using CSS.
